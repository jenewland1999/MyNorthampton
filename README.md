Redesign of The University of Northampton's Student portal web page.

***

This project is a redesign of the existing student portal webpage currently offered at The University of Northampton. During my first few weeks, while my course was getting going, I took it upon myself to improve its aesthetic and usability by implementing a mobile-first, responsive web design that, personally, I feel is a superior improvement over its predecessor. 

This webpage is in no way, shape or form to be used outside of a development and test environment. The property of the website's content belong to those responsible for developing the site and to The University of Northampton. This is mearly an attempt to take an exisitng product and see how I could improve it.
