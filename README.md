# My Northampton

A personal project that overhauled the University of Northampton Student Portal (Extranet). This was achieved through improved RWD utilising CSS Grid with appropriate fallbacks for legacy browsers. The project's success was measured through the use of Google Lighthouse.

## Google Lighthouse Audits

As mentioned above this site was tested using Google Lighthouse Audit a tool for measuring website's performance, accessibility, SEO and best practices.
